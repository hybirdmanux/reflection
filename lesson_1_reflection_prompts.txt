How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    There are too many lines of code you need to check and this siuation is so overwhmling. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    get control of the projects.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    commit should not be time-based. Each commit represent a single logical change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because git is for developer.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use git log to find out commit history. use git diff to find out what change.  

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
